    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "Data science studies how to use data to solve problems and answer research questions. It constitutes all parts of a data-intensive workflow, from the beginning (e.g., data collection, data preparation), through the middle (e.g., data mining, supervised/unsupervised machine learning) to the end (e.g., presenting insights and/or deploying a software system). It helps to think about data science as science, meaning it uses the scientific method we are all familiar with (1. observe/question, 2. research, 3. form a hypothesis, 4. test with experiment, 5. analyze data, 6. report conclusions), but with a focus on data:\n",
    "1. Identify: pick something you are curious about and collect data about it\n",
    "1. Understand: get familiar with your data and its \"bigger picture\"\n",
    "1. Process: prepare your data for analyses \n",
    "1. Analyze: look closely at the data to discover previously unknown patterns, trends, associations, groups, etc\n",
    "1. Conclude: draw valid conclusions and discuss potential action items\n",
    "1. Communicate: share your knowledge with your targeted audience\n",

    "What are examples of data in the real-world and how is that data being analyzed?\n",
    "* Medical data collected from electronic health records, physician/nurse notes, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to determine health risk factors, onset of early disease, insurance billing, etc.\n",
    "* Time series data collected from sensors installed in the environment or worn on the body (wearables)\n",
    "    * Analyzed to detect physical activity, daily behavior, changes in behavior over time, etc.\n",
    "* Social media data collected from social networks, posting, news feeds, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to suggest friends, deliver user-specific content, recommend products, target advertising, etc.\n",
    "* Financial data collected from banking transactions, trading, etc.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "In this class, we are going to learn and use the Python programming language for all of our coding assignments. According to [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022), Python is the top programming language and according to [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/python-preferred-languages-data-science.html), Python is the most popular programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (followed by R). \n",

    "1. Many supported GUI backends\n",
    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",
