    "## Ways to Run Python Code\n",
    "There are several ways to get a Python development environment setup! Here are a few:\n",
    "1. Download and install Python locally on your machine. I recommend installing the Anaconda Python distribution because it contains so many great data science libraries. Visit the [Anaconda downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download Anaconda v3.9 graphical installer for your operating system. Once the download is complete, run the installer. \n",
    "    1. Note: once you have installed Python locally on your machine, you can/should set up a Python virtual environment for your project (see the section below).\n",
    "1. Download and install Docker Desktop locally on your machine. With Docker, you can pull an Anaconda Python image and run this image in a container. A container is \"a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.\"\n",
    "    1. Note: this is the recommended approach for this class so we all are running (and grading) programming assignment code in the exact same, reproducible environment! Plus, you get to learn/practice with Docker!\n",
    "1. Use a cloud-based Python provider. If you don't want to install Python locally, you can use in-browser development environments. Here are a few free ones to check out:\n",

    "### What is Docker? \n",
    "From https://www.docker.com/why-docker:\n",
    "> In 2013, Docker introduced what would become the industry standard for containers. Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its environment, solving the “it works on my machine” headache. For millions of developers today, Docker is the de facto standard to build and share containerized apps - from desktop, to the cloud. We are building on our unique connected experience from code to cloud for developers and developer teams.\n",

    "\n",
    "From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software):\n",
    ">Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[6] Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.[8] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[8] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[9]\n",

    "So why are we using Docker in this class? Here are a few reasons!\n",
    "1. Docker skills are in high demand right now. According to [hackerearth's list of top 9 hottest tech skills to hire for in 2020](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/talent-assessment/hottest-tech-skills-to-hire/), Docker is number 6 on the list (while Python is number 2!). Here is [blog post](https://dev.to/javinpaul/11-essential-skills-software-developers-should-learn-in-2020-1bio) that lists Docker as the number one essential skill software developers should learn in 2020. For fun, do your own searching about Docker and how in demand it has become. Indeed shows that demand for Docker skills continues to surge, up 4,162% since 2014 and it was listed in more than 5% of all US tech jobs in 2019 (from [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3583931/the-most-valuable-software-developer-skills.html))\n",
    "1. One of the most important concepts in data science is *reproducibility*, which is the notion of designing and documenting experiments that are reproducible. This means that you (and others) should be able to reproduce your results. Docker makes it easy to make your results reproducible because you can essentially save your tech stack (e.g. the exact versions of Python, its dependencies, etc.) and distribute it easily to others.\n",
    "1. In this class, we are going to test our code using *unit tests*. A unit test is a test that measures the correctness of one unit, such as a function or a class. With Docker, you can run your tests against your code locally with the *exact same* tech stack (e.g. Docker image) my automated testing setup will run. There won't be any discrepancies in the output of your code running in your Docker container versus my Docker container, so long as we are running containers from the exact same image!\n",
    "1. It is **FUN** to learn new things. In fact, a career in computer science and software development is a career in lifelong learning 🤓\n",

    "Basic Docker terminology you should know (adapted from Microsoft's [Docker terminology post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-terminology) and https://mindmajix.com/docker/basic-terminologies-of-docker):\n",
    "* Container image: A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container (these dependencies are defined in a Dockerfile). An image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution configuration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images that are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container's file system. An image is immutable once it has been created. Below are the major features of a Docker image:\n",
    "    * Portability: The Docker images can easily be pushed or moved into a Docker registry and can also be saved as tar file.\n",
    "    * Layered nature: Images are added using layers. This enables re-usability of images and disk usability is highly reduced as the parent layers are shared.\n",
    "    * Static or Compile-time nature: Though you can create a new Docker image, the contents will remain unchanged.\n",
    "* Container: An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single application, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution environment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances of a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same image, passing different parameters to each instance.\n",
    "* Tag: A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image (depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified.\n",
    "* Repository (repo): A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image version. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs (heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A single repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image.\n",
    "* Registry: A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from multiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they've created. Azure Container Registry is another example.\n",

    "## An Aside: Virtual Environments\n",
    "For collaboration and reproducibility, you can also set up virtual environment for your Python project. As stated by Miguel Grinberg, \"A virtual environment is a copy of the Python interpreter into which you can install packages privately, without affecting the global Python interpreter installed in your system.\" Essentially, you can install the required dependencies for your project to run via the virtual environment. Then, when you are ready to share your project with others, you can export your virtual environment dependencies via a requirements.txt file. It is this txt file that you put under version control (not the virtual environment itself) and you share with others so they can set up their environment to be the same as yours! \n",
    "\n",
    "From https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html:\n",
    "> Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not affect application A’s environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how it works:\n",
    "1. Make a directory for your new Python project and cd into it\n",
    "1. Run `python3 -m venv my-env` where `my-env` is what you want to call your virtual environment (typically the name `env` suffices)\n",
